# Bosses
- A level 10 boss of some type, maybe a demon father, who transformed after a freak accident

# New UI ideas (example: health, defense etc)

- Maybe include basic tier character building like Fallout? I propose: Strength, Perception, Intelligence, Speech and Luck as the only 5, have the player assign points at the start (SLIPS)
  - Maybe add collectibles that increase said stats?
  - Include (special) actions that require a minimum stat requirement

- System that does a "dice roll" after a certain number of player actions to determine whether the player will have an encounter or not.

- System that acts as a shanty inventory, maybe allow 2 pieces of Armor (Head and body), 3 consumables and a weapon at any given time + 1 charm. We could use a simple array to store that data.

- a sort of "reputation" system, which can be used in clans
# Ideas for parts of levels

- One of those McDonald's style plastic jungle jim play areas with all sorts of weird little characters.
- A school level, where you have to navigate through the social hierarchy, interacting with people as you go along. Maybe this can be level 5.
- clans, groups you could join. They can give good rewards if your reputation among the clan itself is high enough. I don't know when we would code this, but we could store reputation in a variable. The interactivity of this could be added later.
