# Bosses

# New UI ideas (example: health, defense etc)

- Maybe include basic tier character building like Fallout? I propose: Strength, Perception, Intelligence, Speech and Luck as the only 5, have the player assign points at the start (SLIPS)
  - Maybe add collectibles that increase said stats?
  - Include (special) actions that require a minimum stat requirement

- System that does a "dice roll" after a certain number of player actions to determine whether the player will have an encounter or not.

- System that acts as a shanty inventory, maybe allow 2 pieces of Armor (Head and body), 3 consumables and a weapon at any given time + 1 charm. We could use a simple array to store that data.
