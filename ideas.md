# Bosses

# New UI ideas (example: health, defense etc)

- Maybe include basic tier character building like Fallout? I propose: Strength, Intuition, Speech and Luck as the only 4, have the player assign points at the start
  - Maybe add collectibles that increase said stats? (charms)
  - Include (special) actions that require a minimum stat requirement

- System that does a "dice roll" after a certain number of player actions to determine whether the player will have an encounter or not.

- System that acts as a shanty inventory, maybe allow 2 pieces of Armor (Head and body), 3 consumables and a weapon at any given time + 1 charm. We could use a simple array to store that data.

- Basic turn based combat with consumable use and attack (either use consumable or attack, can't do both in the same turn obv.)

- Should we allow for 2 weapons or just one? Having two weapons in combat might allow for more creative plays.
  - We could introduce a heavy and light weapon class to balance things out, make sure people don't just spam heavy attacks.

- Consumable item duration to further encourage strategy (1 turn being instant heal).

- Further uses for Stats outside of in game actions to encourage character building, reminder that all of these are for per point assigned:
  - Strength:
    - +1 heavy damage

  - Luck:
    - +3% dodge (base chance = 5%)
    - +5% coin
  
  - Intuition:
    - +1 light damage

  - Speech:
    - Idk tbh, maybe  offer pacifist options in some fights?

- UI print out that specifies the temporary and non temporary buffs you have from items.

# Ideas for parts of levels

- One of those McDonald's style plastic jungle jim play areas with all sorts of weird little characters.
