Made by me as hobby project. This is also coincidentally my first ever proper "game", so I hope anyone who plays it enjoys it thoroughly.
If you want to distribute it, please link your game back to the repo, or credit "stanvol".
Credit to Geigerbuzz, who helped with the final game.
Have fun playing it, and feel free to criticize how inefficient the code is, although if you do do that, please also feel free to get a life
If you complete the full game, with all its endings, first of all, go outside (something I don't do much). But also, thank you, it means a lot.
To all who read this, I wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors
