Made by me as hobby project. This is also coincidentally my first proper "game", so I hope anyone who plays it enjoys it thoroughly.
If you want to distribute it, please link the game back to the repo, or credit "stanvol". (If you want to modify it in any way, feel free to! I won't stop you)
Credit to Geigerbuzz, who helped with the final game (and art, which will be included later).
Have fun playing it, and feel free to criticize how inefficient the code is, although if you do do that, please also feel free to get a life.
If you complete the full game, with all its endings, first of all, go outside (something I don't do much). But also, thank you, it means a lot.
To all who read this, I wish you the best of luck in all your future endeavors
stanvol :)
PS. There are a few easter eggs, so try to find them. If there are any bugs, please tell me (if you can get in contact with me)
